Runtime Governance Samples
==========================

Each of the sub-folders contains a quickstart example. A description of the quickstarts, including how to
build and run them, can be found in the QuickStart guide available here: http://www.jboss.org/overlord/documentation/rtgov,
as well as in individual readme.txt files with the quickstarts.

To build and deploy all of the deloyable quickstarts, simply use the following command from this folder:

	mvn jboss-as:deploy

and to undeploy:

	mvn jboss-as:deploy
