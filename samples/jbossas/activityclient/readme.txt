Activity Client
===============

This quickstart provides a test client for generating activity information. The example business transactions are defined in the src/main/resources/txns folder.

To run the activity client, simply enter the following command from this folder:

mvn clean install -Dcount=1000

The 'count' property represents the number of transactions that will be created and can be set to any value. If set to -1, then the client will run indefinitely.
