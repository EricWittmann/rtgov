Order Management - Information Processing Definitions
=====================================================

This quickstart provides an example configuration for information processors related to the messages
sent and received by the Order Management application. These information processors are responsible
for extracting information that may be required in subsequent event processing.

The information processor is deployed as part of the Order Management app - see readme in the order
management folder.
