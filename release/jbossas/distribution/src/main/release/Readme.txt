OVERLORD Runtime Governance README
==================================

Prerequisites:

Maven (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) version 3.0.4 or higher.

JBoss EAP 6.1.0.GA or higher.

SwitchYard 1.0.0.Final or higher. This will need to be installed into JBoss EAP.


To install the Overlord Runtime Governance system within a JBossEAP environment:

1) Set the JBOSS_HOME environment variable to the root folder of your JBossEAP environment

2) While the JBoss EAP server is not running, run the following command from the root folder of the distribution:

mvn install


This will install all the necessary modules and deployments for the full server. If a 'client only' installation is required, which will report activity events to a remote server, then specify the appropriate configuration using the "-Dtype=client" option.
