SAVARA BAM
==========


Setting the environment
-----------------------

When building the distribution, Arquillian is used to run tests within the target platform. The following environment needs to be setup for the selected target platform:


JBossAS7/Switchyard:

The 'jbossas' target platform requires JBossAS7 with Switchyard. This can be obtained from: http://www.jboss.org/switchyard/downloads

(Note: currently been tested with switchyard-0.5-SNAPSHOT).

Once installed, set the JBOSS_HOME environment variable to point to the root of the switchyard installation.


Building the distribution
-------------------------

From the root folder, build the distribution using:

mvn clean install -P<platform>

where platform can be: jbossas 


Once the build has completed, the distribution can be found in the distribution/jee/target folder.
