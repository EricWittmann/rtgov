============


Setting the environment
-----------------------

When building the repository, the 'distribution' and 'tests' folders are platform specific and therefore need a
target platform to be specified. All other folders are platform agnostic.

The following environment needs to be setup for the selected target platform:


JBossAS7/Switchyard:

The 'jbossas' target platform requires JBossAS7 with Switchyard. This can be obtained from: http://www.jboss.org/switchyard/downloads

(Note: currently been tested with switchyard-0.5-SNAPSHOT).

Once installed, set the JBOSS_HOME environment variable to point to the root of the switchyard installation.



Building the distribution
-------------------------

From the root folder, build the distribution using:

mvn clean install -P<platform>

where platform can be: jbossas 


Once the build has completed, the distribution can be found in the distribution/jee/packaging/target folder.





Contributing
------------

Before submitting a pull request, please perform the following command from the root folder, to check for style issues:

mvn checkstyle:checkstyle

If any errors are reported, then they should be fixed before submitting the pull request.



Generating Javadocs
-------------------

An aggregate set of javadocs can be generated from the root folder using the following command:

mvn javadoc:javadoc

The javadocs will be generated to the target/site folder.
